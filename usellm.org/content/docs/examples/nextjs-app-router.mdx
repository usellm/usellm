title: Next.js (App Router)
description: Build an AI chatbot with `useLLM` and Next.js
---

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of creating a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) AI Chat application powered by the ChatGPT API.

This tutorial is designed using Typescript with the Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional chat application that utilizes the advanced natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT to provide intelligent and interactive conversations.

If you are beginner and not familiar with Typescript, you can follow [this guide](https://usellm.org/docs/examples/nextjs-pages-router)

You can find the finished code of this tutorial in this [Github repository](https://github.com/usellm/example-nextjs-app-router).

Let's get started!

## Setup Development Environment

### Create Github Repository

Follow the steps to create a GitHub repository:

1. Sign in to your GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free at https://github.com/join.

2. Once you're signed in, click on the "+" sign at the top right corner of the GitHub interface. Then, select "New repository" from the dropdown menu.

3. On the "Create a new repository" page, you'll need to provide some information:

   - **Repository name:** Enter a name for your repository. Choose a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your project.
   - **Description (optional):** Add a brief description to provide an overview of your project.
   - **Public or Private:** Choose whether you want your repository to be public (visible to everyone) or private (accessible only to you or collaborators).
   - **Initialize this repository with a README:** Select this option to create an initial README file for your repository. It's a good practice to include a README to provide information about your project.
   - **Choose a license (optional):** If you want to specify a license for your project, you can choose one from the provided list. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

4. Once you've filled in the necessary details, click on the "Create repository" button.

5. Congratulations! You have successfully created a GitHub repository. You'll be redirected to the repository page, where you can find various options and settings for managing your repository.

### Using GitHub Codespaces

We will be using GitHub Codespaces to run the code.
GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub.
It allows developers to write, build, test, and debug code directly in the browser, without the need for local development setups.
With GitHub Codespaces, you can quickly set up and access a fully configured development environment for your projects.

To run code in GitHub Codespaces, follow these steps:

1. Open your GitHub repository.

2. If Codespaces is already enabled for your repository, you will see a green "Code" button at the top right corner of the repository page. Click on the arrow next to it, and select "Open with Codespaces" from the dropdown menu.

   If you haven't set up Codespaces for your repository, you can click on the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces" from the dropdown menu. This will prompt you to configure and set up Codespaces for your repository.

3. Once you click on "Open with Codespaces," GitHub will create a new Codespace based on your repository's configuration. It will set up the necessary development environment, including the required dependencies and tools.

4. After the Codespace is set up, you will be redirected to the Codespaces interface, which provides an integrated development environment (IDE) within your browser.

5. In the Codespaces IDE, you can view and edit the files in your repository. You can navigate through the file structure, make changes to the code, and create new files as needed.

## Create Next.js App

1. Open the terminal by clicking on the terminal panel to activate it.

2. Delete the Readme.md file that you might have created while creating the Github Repository.
   This is to avoid conflict because we are going to setup the Next.js project from scratch, which creates the Readme.md file

3. Create a Next.js app using the following command:

```cmd
npx create-next-app@latest . --use-npm
```

4. After running the above command, you will be asked with the following questions, please answer them as suggested below:

   ✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? > [No] / [**Yes**]

   ✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? > No / [**Yes**]

   ✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? > No / [**Yes**]

   ✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? > [**No**] / Yes

   ✔ Use App Router (recommended)? > No / [**Yes**]

   ✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? > [**No**] / Yes

Once, you answer all the questions, `npx` will setup a Next.js project for you in few seconds.
Once its created, you should see the success message as shown below.

### Installing usellm Dependency

To install the `usellm` dependency using below command.

```cmd
npm install usellm
```

Your app is now ready to be launched. Use the below command to launch it.

```cmd
npm run dev
```

After running the above the code, the App will run and you should see the message in right bottom corner.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BuRLahr.png" />

<br />
You can click "Open in Browser" button to see the App's homepage.

### Project Folder Structure

```plaintext
/my-app
├── .next/                  # This is the output directory of the Next.js build process.
├── node_modules/           # Node.js modules are installed in this directory.
├── app/                    # You can opt to include your source files here.
│   ├── api/                # Create server-side API endpoints for a route
│   ├── chat-example/
│   │    └── page.tsx       # This file contains the unique UI of a route and make the path publicly accessible
├── package.json            # This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts.
├── package-lock.json       # This file is auto-generated and it holds information about the project dependencies tree.
└── .gitignore              # Ignore some files from Git.
```

> **Note:** There might be other folders and files present in the typical Next.js project. Those are out of scope for this particular
> example.

## Creating New Page

To create a new page, you will have to:

- Navigate to the "app" folder
- Create a new folder "chat-example"
- Create a new `.tsx` file `page.tsx` inside "chat-example

```tsx
"use client";
export default function ChatExample() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl w-full mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 px-4">
        This is useLLM chat Example
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can navigate to '/chat-example' to see the output.

<br />

### Add an Input field and Send Button

To create a chat form, we will require an input field and a send button. This can be added like below.

```js
"use client";
export default function ChatExample() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl w-full mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 px-4">
        This is useLLM chat Example
      </h1>
      <div className="w-full py-4 flex px-4">
        <input className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-transparent px-3 py-2 text-sm ring-offset-background file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50" />
        <button className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 h-10 py-2 px-4 ml-2">
          Send
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Output:**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IgzY6Gv.png" />

### Adding onClick Handler

An onClick handler for a button in JavaScript or React is a function that is triggered when the button is clicked.
In this case you can define a function `handleSend` and pass it as a prop to the Send button.

```js
"use client";
export default function ChatExample() {
  async function handleSend() {
    alert("Send is Clicked");
  }

  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl w-full mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 px-4">
        This is useLLM chat Example
      </h1>
      <div className="w-full py-4 flex px-4">
        <input
          placeholder="Enter message here"
          className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-transparent px-3 py-2 text-sm ring-offset-background file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"
        />
        <button
          onClick={handleSend}
          className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 h-10 py-2 px-4 ml-2"
        >
          Send
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you click a button, you should be able to see the alert like below:

**Output:**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zCgQdbI.png" />

### Adding onChange Handler

An `onChange` handler for an input field in JavaScript or React is a function that is triggered whenever the value of the input field changes.
In this case you can define a state `inputText` and a function `setInputText` to set the input field value into `inputText`.
This can be done using `useState(...)` hook.

```js
"use client";
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function ChatExample() {
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");

  async function handleSend() {
    alert("Send is Clicked");
  }

  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl w-full mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 px-4">
        This is useLLM chat Example
      </h1>
      <div className="w-full py-4 flex px-4">
        <input
          onChange={(e) => setInputText(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter message here"
          value={inputText}
          className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-transparent px-3 py-2 text-sm ring-offset-background file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"
        />
        <button
          onClick={handleSend}
          className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 h-10 py-2 px-4 ml-2"
        >
          Send
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Storing Messages History

For storing the messages history, you can use `useState` hook.

```js
"use client";
import useLLM, { OpenAIMessage } from "usellm";
...
const [history, setHistory] = useState<OpenAIMessage[]>([]);
```

To add the message to the history, when Send button is clicked you can update the `handleSend`
function as below:

```js
async function handleSend() {
  if (!inputText) {
    return;
  }
  const newHistory = [...history, { role: "user", content: inputText }]; // Create a new history array by appending the new message
  setHistory(newHistory); // Set the updated message history into the state
  setInputText(""); // Clear the input field after updating the history
}
```

### Showing Messages History

Now lets add some code to show the messages history on the page.
This can be done using map which maps the `history` array to a message element

```js
<div className="max-w-4xl w-full flex-1 overflow-y-auto px-4">
  {history.map((message, idx) => (
    <div key={idx} className="my-4">
      <div className="font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-50">
        {message.role.toUpperCase()}
      </div>
      <div className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">{message.content}</div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

Here is the complete example till now.

```js
"use client";
import React, { useState } from "react";
import useLLM, { OpenAIMessage } from "usellm";

export default function ChatExample() {
  const [history, setHistory] = useState<OpenAIMessage[]>([]);
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");

  async function handleSend() {
    if (!inputText) {
      return;
    }
    const newHistory = [...history, { role: "user", content: inputText }];
    setHistory(newHistory);
    setInputText("");
  }

  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl w-full mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 px-4">
        This is useLLM chat Example
      </h1>
      {history.length > 0 && (
        <div className="max-w-4xl w-full flex-1 overflow-y-auto px-4">
          {history.map((message, idx) => (
            <div key={idx} className="my-4">
              <div className="font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-50">
                {message.role.toUpperCase()}
              </div>
              <div className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                {message.content}
              </div>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
      <div className="w-full py-4 flex px-4">
        <input
          onChange={(e) => setInputText(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter message here"
          value={inputText}
          className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-transparent px-3 py-2 text-sm ring-offset-background file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"
        />
        <button
          onClick={handleSend}
          className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 border border-white focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background bg-transparent text-white  hover:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white h-10 py-2 px-4 ml-2"
        >
          Send
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Output:**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zgJ6VPE.png" />

You should be able to interact with the input box and button.
And should be able to see the messages history on the page when send button is clicked.

## Creating a LLM service

- To get the response from OpenAI, you will need to setup a service that will make an API call.
- To create a service, Go to "app" folder
- Create a "api" folder inside "app" folder
- Create a "llm" folder inside "api" folder
- Create a new file `route.tsx` inside "llm" folder

```.js
import { createLLMService } from "usellm";

const llmService = createLLMService({
  openaiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  actions: ["chat"],
});

export const runtime = "edge";

export default async function POST(request) {
  const body = await request.json();

  try {
    const { result } = await llmService.handle({ body, request });
    return new Response(result, { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("[LLM Service]", error);
    return new Response(error.message, {
      status: error?.status || 400,
    });
  }
}
```

### Create an `.env.local` file

.env.local file is used to store environment variables that are specific to your local development environment.
These variables can be accessed in your Next.js application using the process.env object.

.env.local file should be located in the root directory of your Next.js project.

#### Getting the OpenAI API key

The OpenAI API key is a unique identifier that authorizes and tracks API requests
associated with your project. The useLLM project utilizes this key to interface with
OpenAI's services and resources, such as the GPT-3.5 model. Without this key, your
application wouldn't have the necessary permissions to access these services,
thereby inhibiting functionalities associated with OpenAI's AI models.

Here are the steps to Generate OpenAI API Key:

1. **Navigate to OpenAI API Keys page**: Start by visiting the
   [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page.

2. **Create an Account or Sign In**: If you don't already have an OpenAI account, you'll
   need to create one. If you already have an account, simply click on 'Sign In' and enter your credentials.

3. **Access API Keys Dashboard**: Once you're signed in, you'll be directed to the API
   Keys dashboard. Here, you can manage your existing API keys and create new ones.

4. **Create a New API Key**: To create a new API key, click on the 'Create new' or '+ New key'
   button (depending on the current UI). A new window will open prompting you to provide a
   description for the key. After filling in the details, click 'Create'.

5. **Copy the API Key**: After creating the key, it will be listed in your API Keys dashboard.
   Make sure to copy the key (a long string of alphanumeric characters) immediately, as you won't
   be able to view it again once you leave the page or refresh.

![example](https://i.imgur.com/fO5tiYm.png)

Once you obtain the API key, create a `.env.local` file to store the `OPENAI_API_KEY` used while creating LLM service using `createLLMService`.

```.env
OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY'
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6z2TF6d.png" />

## Integrating Service

Now the service is ready and you can use it to send the input field value to the service and
get the response from the service and show it on the page.

### Import the usellm library

```js
import useLLM, { OpenAIMessage } from "usellm";
```

You will have to create a service using useLLM

```js
const llm = useLLM({ serviceUrl: "/api/llm" });
```

You can set the `stream` to `true`, so that the response starts printing word by word.

Complete code for the `chat-example.tsx` page

```js
"use client";
import React, { useState } from "react";
import useLLM, { OpenAIMessage } from "usellm";

export default function ChatExample() {
  const [history, setHistory] = useState<OpenAIMessage[]>([]);
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");

  const llm = useLLM({ serviceUrl: "/api/llm" });

  async function handleSend() {
    if (!inputText) {
      return;
    }
    const newHistory = [...history, { role: "user", content: inputText }];
    setHistory(newHistory);
    setInputText("");

    llm.chat({
      messages: newHistory,
      stream: true,
      onStream: ({ message }) => setHistory([...newHistory, message]),
    });
  }

  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl w-full mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 px-4">
        This is useLLM chat Example
      </h1>
      {history.length > 0 && (
        <div className="max-w-4xl w-full flex-1 overflow-y-auto px-4">
          {history.map((message, idx) => (
            <div key={idx} className="my-4">
              <div className="font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-50">
                {message.role.toUpperCase()}
              </div>
              <div className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                {message.content}
              </div>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
      <div className="w-full py-4 flex px-4">
        <input
          onChange={(e) => setInputText(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter message here"
          value={inputText}
          className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-transparent px-3 py-2 text-sm ring-offset-background file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"
        />
        <button
          onClick={handleSend}
          className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 border border-white focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background bg-transparent text-white  hover:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white h-10 py-2 px-4 ml-2"
        >
          Send
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have now successfully set up and built the Next.js Chat application using `usellm` library.
You can find the complete code in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/usellm/example-nextjs-app-router).
