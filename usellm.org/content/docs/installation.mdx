description: Install useLLM within your React project using npm, yarn, or pnpm
---

In this page, we will guide you through the process of installing useLLM with different
package managers. We'll also cover some important prerequisites and usage details.

### Prerequisites

The useLLM library is designed to be used with React. Consequently, you need to have
React installed in your project. If you're building a web application, it is also likely
that you are using a framework like Next.js. If you're just getting started with a new
project, you can install React and Next.js together using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Check out the documentation for [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) to learn more.

### Installing useLLM

You can install useLLM using different JavaScript package managers like `npm`, `yarn`,
and `pnpm`.

#### npm

npm is the default package manager for Node.js. If you have Node.js installed,
you probably already have npm. To install useLLM with npm, run the following
command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install usellm
```

#### yarn

Yarn is an alternative package manager created by Facebook. If you prefer using
yarn, you can install useLLM using the following command:

```bash
yarn add usellm
```

#### pnpm

pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient package manager. If you're using pnpm,
you can install useLLM with the following command:

```bash
pnpm add usellm
```

### Using useLLM

After installing useLLM, you can import and use the `useLLM` hook in your React components:

```javascript
import useLLM from "usellm";

// Inside your React component:
const llm = useLLM({ serviceUrl: "https://usellm.org/api/llm" });
```

Please note that the `useLLM` hook is supposed to be used in a React component,
and it must follow the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning).

Also remember to replace `"https://usellm.org/api/llm"` with your own service URL.
You may refer to the [Quickstart](https://usellm.org/docs) and the
[API Reference](https://usellm.org/docs/api-reference/usellm-hook) for more details.
